# Scripts

## Intro

This repositiory is more of a 'cheat sheet' for myself, but others may potentially find it useful.

Primarily, the purpose is to be able to document my installs/docker containers so that I can easily recreate my setup if I need to reinstall.

## To Do

- [ ] Update docker run to compose file(s)
- [ ] Update Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 18.10
  - [ ] Add fstab settings
- [ ] Update Server Install(s) instructions (this may be a while as the server will probably not be re-installed for a while)
